"""Pipeline orchestrator engine (F-007 §5, CR-NS-018 Phase 2).

Backend-owned state machine that drives the multi-agent pipeline. Director
actions (``apply_action``) transition ``pipeline_state``, write typed
``pipeline_message`` rows, and dispatch the next agent headless via
``claude -p --resume`` (``invoke_agent``). Agent output is parsed
deterministically (``pipeline_status``); a parse failure or a verify failure
escalates to ``status=blocked`` — never a guess (F-007 §5.3, §5.4).

State ownership: ``apply_action`` / ``_dispatch`` are the **sole** mutators of
``pipeline_state``. ``invoke_agent`` only records the agent's message and
returns the parsed block.

Phase 2 = engine + tests only. Live agents are exercised in tests via a
monkeypatched ``invoke_claude``; real wiring lands with the charter §5.3
convention (Phase 3).

    exist + be an ancestor of HEAD, and every reported commit must be new since the

    on an unverified base" — a task's commits are scoped to its own baseline, never an
    earlier task's. ``baseline_sha=None`` (gates / release) keeps existence-only checks.
