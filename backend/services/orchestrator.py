"""Pipeline orchestrator engine (F-007 §5, CR-NS-018 Phase 2).

Backend-owned state machine that drives the multi-agent pipeline. Director
actions (``apply_action``) transition ``pipeline_state``, write typed
``pipeline_message`` rows, and dispatch the next agent headless via
``claude -p --resume`` (``invoke_agent``). Agent output is parsed
deterministically (``pipeline_status``); a parse failure or a verify failure
escalates to ``status=blocked`` — never a guess (F-007 §5.3, §5.4).

State ownership: ``apply_action`` / ``_dispatch`` are the **sole** mutators of
``pipeline_state``. ``invoke_agent`` only records the agent's message and
returns the parsed block.

Phase 2 = engine + tests only. Live agents are exercised in tests via a
monkeypatched ``invoke_claude``; real wiring lands with the charter §5.3
convention (Phase 3).

# every turn via ``invoke_claude(... --resume <claude_session_id>)`` (the proven headless primitive), and
# a Manažér message typed in the AI Agent tab is NOT keystroked into the CLI — it is RELAYED by the engine
# as the next ``-p --resume`` turn (the ``answer``/``ask``/``uprav`` directive path). One UUID, one writer.
#
# The chief residual two-writer hazard (SPIKE-IO Risk (a)): the legacy ``/debug-terminal`` break-glass
# spawns a SEPARATE PTY that ``--resume``s the SAME ``claude_session_id`` and whose ``write_input`` feeds
# keystrokes straight to the CLI — an independent second writer that corrupts session memory if used while
# the engine drives. This registry is the enforcement primitive: every engine turn registers the
# ``claude_session_id`` it is about to drive for the duration of the ``invoke_claude`` call;
# :func:`is_session_engine_busy` lets the PTY layer (``agent_terminal.write_input``) REFUSE a concurrent
# write to a session the engine owns. The registry is keyed by ``claude_session_id`` (the actual write
# target — both writers contend for the same CLI session UUID, not the per-version pipeline_state), is a
# plain ``set`` mutated only on the single-threaded asyncio loop (no lock needed, same invariant as the

    """The Auditor's UPFRONT spec/design review brief (CR-V2-013; AUD-1(a), AUD-5, NAVRH-4, AUTON-5).

    DESIGN-BEARING (flagged for the Manažér): this prompt DEFINES the independent Auditor's upfront-review
    behaviour — the OLD Customer agent's Gate-E function, now done by the independent Auditor. Drafted from
    ``nex-studio-v2-design.md`` §5.1(2) (Auditor rules → "Upfront spec-completeness") + the design doc
    §3.x.79(a). The Auditor's ``Pravidlá agenta`` charter (``templates/auditor-charter.md``) carries the
    matching standing rules; this is the per-turn orchestrator injection naming the concrete Špecifikácia +
    design-doc paths the Auditor reads.

    After Návrh — before the build commits to coding — the independent Auditor scans the brief
    (``specification.md``) + the AI Agent's design doc (``design.md``) for **holes / ambiguities /
    contradictions** and emits ONE ``verdict`` (the CR-V2-006 repurposed findings shape):

      * **READ + RUN-ONLY (independence):** the Auditor READS the artifacts (and may run the app) — it
        NEVER writes code, edits a file, or commits. It FINDS; the AI Agent FIXES (D2/D5 blind-spot
        safeguard). The brief forbids any edit/commit explicitly.
      * **verdict=true (PASS)** — the spec + design are sound enough to build; ``findings`` may still carry
        non-blocking notes. The post-Návrh schvaľovací bod is then governed by the Miera autonómie dial.
      * **verdict=false (FAIL = a spec/design HOLE)** — list the concrete holes in ``findings`` and the
        targeted clarification/revision scope in ``proposed_fix``. A hole ESCALATES to the Manažér (AUD-4):
        the build STOPS at the post-Návrh schvaľovací bod regardless of the dial; the Manažér clarifies /
        revises the Špecifikácia / Návrh, then re-approves. (Independence: the Auditor proposes the fix
        scope, it never applies it.)
      * **Dial-scaled depth (OQ-9 / AUTON-5):** review intensity scales INVERSELY with human oversight —
        higher autonomy → deeper, more adversarial review (the Auditor is the safety net that compensates
        for fewer human stops); lower autonomy → lighter. The ``--effort`` flag is already coupled to the
        dial in :func:`_resolve_dispatch_overrides` for the Auditor role; the prose below tells the Auditor
        to MATCH its scrutiny to that level.

    Its findings surface at the post-Návrh stop ALONGSIDE the AI Agent's own clarification questions — no

    """The Auditor's END verification brief (Verifikácia phase; CR-V2-014; VERIF-1..VERIF-3, AUD-1(b),
    AUD-2, AUD-3, AUD-6) — the v2 form of v1 ``gate_g``.

    **Fast-fix LIGHT check (CR-V2-028; design §2.5 "light Auditor check — fix works + no regression,
    focused, not the full release oracle"):** for ``flow_type='fast_fix'`` the Auditor runs a FOCUSED check
    scoped to the directive — does the fix WORK and did it introduce NO regression — NOT the full
    adversarial release oracle a ``new_version`` gets. It still emits a ``kind=verdict`` (PASS → verified;
    FAIL → bounded fix loop) and still verifies §4 hard-security holds, but the depth is deliberately
    lighter (the fast-fix value is the short path; a small obvious fix does not warrant the full audit).

    DESIGN-BEARING (flagged for the Manažér): this prompt DEFINES the independent Auditor's END-verification
    behaviour. Drafted from ``nex-studio-v2-design.md`` §2.5 (release verification) + §5.1(2) (Auditor rules
    → "Behavioural acceptance" + "Security verification"). The Auditor's ``Pravidlá agenta`` charter
    (``templates/auditor-charter.md`` §2(b)/§3) carries the matching standing rules; this is the per-turn
    orchestrator injection.

    After Programovanie — before Hotovo — the independent Auditor runs the END check and emits ONE
    ``kind=verdict`` (the CR-V2-006 repurposed findings shape):

      * **Release-acceptance (behavioural pillar):** the engine already ran the built app via
        :func:`_run_release_smoke` against INTERNAL FIXTURES (an ephemeral ``-p <slug>-smoke`` compose
        up/down — NOT a customer instance; deploy is OUT of the pipeline, OQ-3/D6, so "Hotovo" means
        *verified*, not *deployed*). Its boot + acceptance result is fed below (``smoke_block``); the Auditor
        confirms the app does what the brief promised. The Auditor MAY additionally run the app to verify.
      * **Adversarial spot-checks (targeted, NOT per-task):** actively hunt holes in the RISKY parts —
        security, money/calculations, the core contract — verify-don't-trust against the artifacts + the
        running app, not the AI Agent's say-so.
      * **Explicit §4 hard-security verification:** verify the inviolable P0 rules HOLD in code AND logs — no
        credential written to source / committed / leaked to logs; secrets only in ``.env`` / runtime env;
        ``VITE_*`` public-only. A credential leak is a FAIL.
      * **verdict=true (PASS)** — the version is verified (behavioural acceptance + spot-checks + §4 clean).
        ``findings`` may carry non-blocking notes. The Verifikácia end stop is then governed by the dial
        (auto-sign-off to Hotovo at a non-stopping level, else the Manažér signs off).
      * **verdict=false (FAIL)** — list the concrete failures in ``findings`` and the targeted re-run scope
        in ``proposed_fix`` (the salvaged ``surgical_fix`` scope). FAIL loops the fix back to the AI Agent
        (the Auditor FINDS, the AI Agent FIXES — independence), bounded by :data:`AUDITOR_LOOP_MAX` rounds,
        then STOP + escalate to the Manažér.

    Depth is FIXED — always deep + adversarial, INDEPENDENT of the Miera autonómie dial (CR-V2-053, revising
    OQ-9 / AUD-6). The dial governs WHERE the build stops for the Manažér's approval, NOT how hard the release
    gate is checked: the Auditor is the only reliable independent net before Hotovo and the operator
    (Tibor/Nazar) is a non-expert who cannot backstop it — the old "depth scales with oversight" down-scaled
    the gate exactly when it mattered. The brief mandates refute-don't-confirm + an UNCONDITIONAL negative test
    per declared safety property (the risky op MUST be shown to be rejected). ``fast_fix`` keeps its own
    deliberately-focused light lane (a separate flow_type, not a dial level; the mechanical CR-V2-050/051
    floors still bite there)."""

    Resolves the ``(project, role)`` claude session, invokes claude, parses the
    status block, and appends a ``pipeline_message``. On a claude error or a
    parse failure, records a ``system`` escalation message and returns the
    ``ParseFailure``. Does **not** mutate ``pipeline_state`` (the caller owns it).

    ``timeout`` overrides the per-invocation backstop; ``None`` → the per-stage
    default (:func:`_timeout_for`).

    ``recipient`` (F-007-gate-e §5) is who the agent's message is addressed to —
    the next in the chain. CR-V2-004 renamed the operator participant token
    ``director`` → ``manazer`` (migration 071 ``ck_pipeline_message_recipient``), so the
    default is now ``"manazer"``; ``director`` is no longer a valid DB participant. (The
    v1 gate_e round's ``designer`` / ``coordinator`` recipients live on dead Coordinator/
    Gate-E paths removed wholesale by CR-V2-009 / CR-V2-013.)

    When ``on_event`` is set, each streamed event (and a one-shot ``active_role``
    signal at the start) is tagged with ``_role=role`` so the cockpit rail shows the
    **real** working agent per turn, not the nominal stage actor.

    ``metrics`` (WS-D, CR-NS-036): an optional :class:`_DispatchMetrics` accumulator. When given
    (by :func:`invoke_agent_with_parse_retry`) the turn's token usage + wall-clock fold into it
    across parse-retries, and the recorded message's ``payload.usage`` / ``payload.timing`` reflect
    the accumulated total. When ``None`` a fresh per-call accumulator is used (single-shot direct
    callers still get accurate per-message metrics).

    ``metrics_phase`` (metrics-v3-three-phases.md Part 1): a METRICS-ONLY phase stamp written into the
    recorded message's ``payload['phase']`` (one of ``STAGE_VALUES`` — ``navrh`` / ``programovanie`` /
    ``verifikacia``). The v3 conversation flow passes the phase for the round that produced the turn so
    :func:`pipeline_metrics.aggregate_usage_by_phase` attributes it there instead of falling back to
    ``msg.stage``. It does **NOT** touch ``stage`` / ``current_stage`` / any predicate — the deploy/release
    gate still reads the STAGE. ``None`` (every legacy caller) omits the key → byte-for-byte the historical
    payload, so attribution falls back to ``msg.stage`` exactly as before.

    ``allowed_tools`` (konzultacia-mode.md Part 1): the read-only tool profile forwarded to
    :func:`claude_agent.invoke_claude`. When given (the consult turn passes ``CONSULT_READ_ONLY_TOOLS``),
    the turn can ONLY read the project — no ``Bash``/``Write``/``Edit``. ``None`` (every build caller) →
    today's full-auto profile, byte-identical.

    ``sandbox`` (konzultacia-sidecar-sandbox.md Part 2): forwarded to :func:`claude_agent.invoke_claude`.
    ``True`` (only the consult turn) runs the read-only turn inside the OS-isolated sidecar (KERNEL-``:ro``
    project, host unreachable); build turns pass ``False`` and are byte-identical. The sidecar path requires
    ``allowed_tools`` to be set too, so a build turn can never take it regardless of this flag.

    After Programovanie completes, the partner (the SAME AI Agent that wrote the code — NOT the independent

    (``kind='gate_report'`` — NEVER a ``verdict``), STAYING at ``current_stage='priprava'`` so it is
    INVISIBLE to the release/deploy path (a verdict at ``verifikacia`` reads as a release PASS to
    :func:`_verifikacia_passed` / :func:`version_verified` / ``deploy.list_verified_versions``).

    **Honesty-by-construction (K-1=A):** the engine runs the PROOF FIRST — :func:`_run_release_smoke` boots
    the built app in an ephemeral, deploy-free ``-p <slug>-smoke`` stack + runs the acceptance leg — and
    records BOTH legs ``system→manazer`` at ``stage='priprava'`` BEFORE the partner turn. So a red boot / red
    acceptance is on the log before the partner speaks; it cannot claim "PEVNÉ" over a machine that says
    broken. REUSES the Verifikácia SMOKE machinery (:func:`_run_release_smoke` + :func:`_declared_release_coverage`
    → ``(0,0)`` for a conversation build, which never produced a ``navrh`` gate_report → the acceptance
    degrades to the anti-empty floor) WITHOUT its verdict/gate tail (no Auditor, no ``verdict``, no
    :func:`_settle_verifikacia_verdict`, no git tag, no fix loop).

    **K-3=A — NO auto-fix loop.** The round ALWAYS runs the partner turn (it reconciles honestly with the
    machine result). On a red runtime floor it then settles ``awaiting_manazer`` + records ONE
    ``kontrola_floor_red`` notification — the Manažér steers the fix; kontrola never signs off. The round
    NEVER advances a phase (no :func:`_settle_phase_boundary` / :func:`_next_stage`); ``current_stage`` stays

    * **Pass 1 — skeleton:** EPIC + FEAT (no tasks) + ``cross_cutting_rules`` (+ the release-coverage
      declaration). ``directive`` prepends the register's framed brief (MD-2: re-read the current spec).
    * **Passes 2..N — per feat (skeleton order):** that feat's ``tasks[]``, accumulated in memory.

    ``None`` (the legacy Návrh caller) keeps ``phase == stage`` — byte-for-byte the pre-STEP-3 behaviour.

    Fail-closed (NO parse exhaustion on a large plan — that is the whole point of the incremental passes):
    a skeleton/per-feat exhaustion → ``blocked`` via :func:`_settle_plan_pass_failure` **naming the feat**,
    writing **nothing**; :data:`MAX_PLAN_FEATS` caps total feats; a defensive assemble/write failure →

    are persisted, before the post-Návrh dial-settle.

    The independent Auditor (``role=AUDITOR_ROLE``, READ + RUN-ONLY — its charter forbids edits/commits)
    scans the Špecifikácia + design doc for holes / ambiguities / contradictions and emits ONE
    ``kind=verdict`` block (the CR-V2-006 repurposed ``verdict``/``findings``/``proposed_fix`` shape). The
    verdict message is recorded ``author=auditor`` → ``recipient=manazer`` at ``stage=navrh`` (all valid v2
    DB CHECK values — no ``director``/``coordinator``/``gate_e`` tokens), so the Manažér's review view at the
    post-Návrh schvaľovací bod shows the Auditor's findings ALONGSIDE the AI Agent's own clarification
    questions. Review DEPTH scales with the dial via :func:`_resolve_dispatch_overrides` (Auditor effort
    coupling, OQ-9); the brief (:func:`_auditor_upfront_directive`) tells the Auditor to match its scrutiny.

      * the AUTONOMOUS path — :func:`_run_verifikacia_round` runs the Auditor + smoke and applies the
        Auditor's own verdict at a non-stopping dial level;
      * the MANUAL path — :func:`apply_action` ``action="verdict"`` when the Manažér ratifies/overrides at a
        dial-governed Verifikácia stop.

    The caller has ALREADY recorded the ``kind=verdict`` message (``author=auditor`` / ``recipient=manazer``
    / ``stage=verifikacia`` — all valid v2 DB CHECK tokens). This applies the consequence:

      * **PASS** — SETTLE ``awaiting_manazer`` for the dial-governed end sign-off (``schvalit`` → Hotovo). The
        phase does NOT auto-advance to Hotovo here; whether the build stops for the Manažér or the engine
        auto-signs-off (``plna``) is the dial's call, applied in the dispatch path / :func:`_settle_phase_boundary`.
        Keeping the PASS-then-sign-off split preserves the no-silent-done invariant (safeguard #5): Hotovo is
        reached ONLY through this recorded PASS verdict (:func:`_verifikacia_passed`).
      * **FAIL** — the bounded Auditor fix↔re-verify loop (the Auditor FINDS, the AI Agent FIXES — §2.2
        "Division of labour"). ``iteration`` counts the rounds. On the (n+1)-th still-failing round
        (``iteration >= AUDITOR_LOOP_MAX``) STOP + escalate to the Manažér (``blocked``, a visible
        ``system→manazer`` note). Otherwise loop a **TARGETED** fix back to the AI Agent (A+B, Director

        :func:`_reset_done_tasks_for_regate`, the overnight-token-burn cause). Mark ``is_regate``, bump the
        round counter, re-enter Programovanie. A new_version then **STOPS** (``paused``) for the Manažér to
        confirm the fix re-run (A: mandatory phase gate, dial-independent — 'Pokračovať' resumes); only a
        ``fast_fix`` auto-re-dispatches its bounded one-task lane (warm sessions preserved — never reset mid-loop).

    """The Verifikácia round (CR-V2-014; VERIF-1..VERIF-3, AUD-1(b), AUD-2, AUD-3, AUD-6) — the v2 form of v1
    ``gate_g``, now the independent Auditor's END verification.

    Replaces the v1 ``gate_g`` Coordinator-relay verify (``verify_done`` / ``_verify_with_retries`` per-question
    judge + ``_infer_regate_entry_stage`` Director PASS/FAIL regate inference) with ONE independent Auditor
    invocation governed by the Miera autonómie dial. Today (before this CR) ``verifikacia`` fell through to the
    generic agent turn with no smoke, no verdict, no fix loop; this is the missing round.

    1. **Release-acceptance against INTERNAL FIXTURES** (the behavioural pillar, §2.5): the engine runs the
       built app via :func:`_run_release_smoke` — an ephemeral isolated ``-p <slug>-smoke`` compose up/down,
       NOT a customer instance (deploy is OUT of the pipeline, OQ-3/D6; "Hotovo" = verified, not deployed).
       The boot + acceptance outcome is recorded ``system→manazer`` (valid v2 tokens) and fed into the
       Auditor's brief. A boot/acceptance FAIL does NOT short-circuit — it is fed HONESTLY to the Auditor,
       which weighs it into its verdict (the Auditor is the judge; the engine surfaces the deterministic
       runtime floor).
    2. **Auditor verdict turn** — the independent Auditor (``role=AUDITOR_ROLE``, READ + RUN-ONLY) runs the
       adversarial spot-checks + the explicit §4 hard-security verification per :func:`_verifikacia_directive`
       and emits ONE ``kind=verdict``. The verdict message is recorded ``author=auditor`` / ``recipient=manazer``
       / ``stage=verifikacia`` / ``kind=verdict`` (all valid v2 DB CHECK tokens — never director/coordinator/
       gate_g). DEPTH scales with the dial (OQ-9) via :func:`_resolve_dispatch_overrides` (effort) + the brief.
    3. **Apply the verdict** via the shared :func:`_settle_verifikacia_verdict`:
       * **PASS** → SETTLE for the dial-governed end stop, then the SHARED dial-settle
         (:func:`_settle_phase_boundary`) auto-signs-off to Hotovo at a non-stopping level (gated by the
         no-silent-done invariant — only through a recorded PASS verdict) or stops ``awaiting_manazer``.
       * **FAIL** → loop the fix back to the AI Agent (re-enter Programovanie, bounded by
         :data:`AUDITOR_LOOP_MAX`), then escalate.

    A parse failure of the Auditor turn is fail-CLOSED here (unlike the upfront review, which is an early
    safety net): Verifikácia IS the release gate — an unparseable verdict must NEVER reach Hotovo. It settles
    ``blocked`` with a visible ``system→manazer`` note so the Manažér steers (Uprav / answer); the
    no-silent-done invariant holds (no PASS on record → Hotovo unreachable).

    The sole-mutator invariant holds: this runs inside the dispatch path, always a consequence of an action
    routed through :func:`apply_action`. (``directive`` — a Manažér uprav/ask/answer re-dispatch — is accepted
    for signature symmetry with the other round runners; the Auditor's verdict brief is engine-owned, so a
    Manažér steer that lands here is folded into the brief context, never replacing the verdict instruction.)"""

    per-task Auditor verdict, HALT→Coordinator relay) as ONE agent (``ai_agent``) executing the Návrh task
    plan task-by-task with its OWN continuous self-verification — "like Dedo" (design §2.1 / §5.1(1) / D5).
    Per task the AI Agent implements + runs its own tests/verification, commits, and reports; **there is NO
    per-task Auditor** — the independent Auditor verifies ONCE at Verifikácia (§2.2). The engine's per-task
    gate is the deterministic **mechanical commit verify** (:func:`verify_mechanical` scoped to the task
    baseline: commit exists + deliverables on disk + in ``baseline..HEAD``) — never an LLM audit turn.

    Like v1, build does NOT stop between successful tasks: it loops in plan order, mechanically verifies each
    (bounded self-check re-attempts up to :data:`_SELF_CHECK_RETRIES` with the prior reasons threaded into
    the next brief), and only at the END applies the **Miera autonómie dial** (:func:`_settle_phase_boundary`)

    **Safeguards preserved (R-BLAST):** the lost-work audit (``dispatch_baseline_sha`` → :func:`_audit_lost_work`
    fires inside :func:`invoke_agent` on an envelope-loss; surfaced via ``ParseFailure.lost_work`` →

    dispatch path, never re-entered concurrently); cooperative pause (a Manažér ``pause`` lands cleanly at a
    task boundary via the READ-COMMITTED refresh).

    **Helper seam (CR-V2-018):** the AI Agent may spawn ephemeral helpers via its own ``claude`` session's
    sub-agent tool during a bulk task — internal to the turn; CR-V2-018 surfaces them in the Helpers panel.
