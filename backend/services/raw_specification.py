"""Service layer for :class:`~backend.db.models.specifications.RawSpecification`.

Provides the synchronous CRUD surface used by API routers. All methods
accept ``db: Session`` as the first argument and only ever call
``session.flush()`` — transaction commit is the router's responsibility.
Errors are signalled via :class:`ValueError` so the router can translate
them to the appropriate HTTP status code.

Design notes (per DESIGN.md §1.7 RawSpecification, §2
``raw_specifications`` table, §3.1 ``SpecificationPage`` /
``RawSpecInput``, and :mod:`backend.db.models.specifications.RawSpecification`):

    * ``id``, ``created_at`` and ``updated_at`` are server-managed and
      therefore immutable from the service layer (``updated_at`` is
      auto-stamped by the ORM via ``onupdate=func.now()`` on flush).
    * ``project_id`` and ``created_by`` are immutable foreign keys — a
      raw specification belongs to exactly one project and is
      attributed to exactly one uploader for its lifetime (new
      submissions are new rows, not a reassignment).
      :class:`RawSpecificationUpdate` deliberately omits them and the
      service's ``allowed_fields`` allow-list enforces that contract
      defensively. This mirrors the treatment of ``project_id`` and
      ``created_by`` on
      :class:`~backend.schemas.architect_session.ArchitectSessionUpdate`.
    * ``input_format`` is constrained by the
      ``ck_raw_specifications_input_format`` DB CHECK (``text | pdf |
      docx``). The Pydantic
      :data:`~backend.schemas.raw_specification.RawSpecificationInputFormat`
      literal mirrors the DB constraint, so the service does not
      revalidate — if an invalid value ever reaches the service (e.g.
      a bypassed schema) the DB CHECK rejects it on flush.
    * ``status`` is constrained by the
      ``ck_raw_specifications_status`` DB CHECK (``pending |
      processing | done | failed``). The Pydantic
      :data:`~backend.schemas.raw_specification.RawSpecificationStatus`
      literal mirrors the DB constraint. Unlike
      :class:`~backend.db.models.architect.ArchitectSession` and
      :class:`~backend.db.models.bugs.Bug`, ``RawSpecification`` has
      no lifecycle-timestamp column (no ``processed_at`` / ``done_at``
      / ``failed_at``), so no auto-stamp convenience is required — a
      transition between statuses is a simple column update.
    * :class:`RawSpecification` has **no** UNIQUE constraints beyond
      the PK — a project may legitimately hold many raw specifications
      (historical submissions, re-uploads, iterations).
      :func:`create` therefore performs no pre-flush natural-key check.
    * The single inbound FK
      (``professional_specifications.raw_spec_id``) uses
      ``ON DELETE CASCADE``, so dependent AI-generated professional
      specifications are removed automatically at the DB level. No
      RESTRICT dependency check is required in :func:`delete`. In
      normal operation raw specifications are retained as submission
      history; :func:`delete` is reserved for test fixtures / admin
      tooling where the upload itself must go.
    * List filters (``project_id``, ``status``, ``created_by``,
      ``input_format``, ``language``) match the indexed columns
      (``ix_raw_specifications_project_id``,
      ``ix_raw_specifications_status``) and support the Specification
      Pipeline UI (DESIGN.md §3.1 ``SpecificationPage`` /
      ``RawSpecInput``) — "list this project's raw specifications",
      "show uploads still pending AI processing", "show this user's
      submissions", "show only PDF uploads".
    * List ordering is ``created_at DESC`` so the most recently
      uploaded specifications appear first, matching the Specification
      Pipeline UI convention (latest uploads on top), consistent with
      the rest of the service layer.
