"""Service layer for :class:`~backend.db.models.kb.KbDocument`.

Provides the synchronous CRUD surface used by API routers. All methods
accept ``db: Session`` as the first argument and only ever call
``session.flush()`` — transaction commit is the router's responsibility.
Errors are signalled via :class:`ValueError` so the router can translate
them to the appropriate HTTP status code.

Design notes (per DESIGN.md §1.10 KbDocument, §1.4 Knowledge Base
(``kb_documents`` table) and :mod:`backend.db.models.kb.KbDocument`):

    * ``id``, ``created_at`` and ``updated_at`` are server-managed and
      therefore immutable from the service layer (``updated_at`` is
      auto-stamped by the ORM via ``onupdate=func.now()`` on flush).
    * ``project_id`` is an immutable foreign key — a KB document's
      scope (project-specific vs ICC-wide, DESIGN.md §1.4 "NULL =
      ICC-wide document") is an identity attribute rather than a
      mutable property. :class:`KbDocumentUpdate` deliberately omits it
      and the service's ``allowed_fields`` allow-list enforces that
      contract defensively. This mirrors the treatment of
      ``project_id`` on
      :class:`~backend.schemas.design_document.DesignDocumentUpdate`.
    * ``doc_category`` is likewise immutable — it is an identity
      discriminator (``standards`` | ``decisions`` | ``lessons`` |
      ``patterns`` | ``design`` | ``behavior`` | ``session``) that
      determines the document's storage location and routing
      semantics. Re-categorising a document in place makes no business
      sense; the caller is expected to :func:`delete` / :func:`create`
      instead. This mirrors the treatment of ``doc_type`` on
      :class:`~backend.schemas.design_document.DesignDocumentUpdate`
      and ``role`` on
      :class:`~backend.schemas.architect_message.ArchitectMessageUpdate`.
    * ``module_id`` remains mutable: ``NULL`` denotes a project-level
      (or ICC-wide when ``project_id`` is also ``NULL``) document
      (DESIGN.md §1.4 "NULL = project-level or ICC-wide") and the
      DB-level ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` naturally expresses the same
      transition when the referenced module is removed. In-place
      re-scoping of an existing document is rare but expressible.
    * ``doc_category`` is constrained by the
      ``ck_kb_documents_doc_category`` DB CHECK. The Pydantic
      :data:`~backend.schemas.kb_document.KbDocumentCategory` literal
      mirrors the DB constraint, so the service does not revalidate —
      if an invalid value ever reaches the service (e.g. a bypassed
      schema) the DB CHECK rejects it on flush.
    * :class:`KbDocument` has **no** UNIQUE constraints beyond the PK.
      Multiple rows sharing the same ``(project_id, module_id,
      doc_category, file_path)`` are tolerated (e.g. re-indexing
      flows); :func:`create` therefore performs no pre-flush
      natural-key check.
    * ``kb_documents`` has **no inbound foreign keys** — no other
      table references it. :func:`delete` therefore performs no
      RESTRICT dependency check and is a straightforward hard-delete.
      The outbound FKs ``project_id`` (``ON DELETE CASCADE``) and
      ``module_id`` (``ON DELETE SET NULL``) keep the row
      self-consistent when the parent rows change.
    * List filters (``project_id``, ``module_id``, ``doc_category``,
      ``qdrant_point_id``) match the indexed columns
      (``ix_kb_documents_project_id``, ``ix_kb_documents_module_id``,
      ``ix_kb_documents_doc_category``,
      ``ix_kb_documents_qdrant_point_id``) and cover the natural
      lookup paths used by the KB browser (DESIGN.md §3.1
      ``KnowledgeBasePage``) and the Architect context-injection flow
      — "list every document for this project", "list every document
      scoped to this module", "list every ``decisions`` document",
      "reverse-lookup a document by its Qdrant point id". An
      ``indexed`` flag narrows the list to rows that have / have not
      been indexed yet (``qdrant_point_id IS NOT NULL`` /
      ``indexed_at IS NOT NULL``).
    * List ordering is ``created_at DESC`` so the most recently added
      document appears first, matching the typical KB-browser "newest
      first" convention (DESIGN.md §3.1 ``KnowledgeBasePage``).
