"""Deterministic parser for the agent status block (F-007 §5.3, CR-NS-018 Phase 2; v2 CR-V2-006).

Every orchestrated agent (the AI Agent or the Auditor — v2's two roles) ends a
response with a machine-readable block (OQ-10: this block SURVIVES into v2; we do
NOT infer phase/await from live PTY text)::

    <<<PIPELINE_STATUS>>>
    { "stage": "...", "kind": "...", "summary": "...", "awaiting": "...",
      "deliverables": [...], "commits": [...], "question": "..." }
    <<<END_PIPELINE_STATUS>>>

The parser is **deterministic** — any deviation (missing/duplicate fence,
invalid JSON, schema/enum violation, ``question``-required-but-absent) returns
a :class:`ParseFailure`. The orchestrator maps that to ``status=blocked`` +
escalation and **never guesses** (F-007 §5.3, §11.3).

``stage`` is one of the **4 v2 phases** (Príprava → Návrh → Programovanie →
Verifikácia) + ``done`` (CR-V2-006, matching the DB ``STAGE_VALUES`` tuple); the
v1 11-stage gate path (``gate_a``…``gate_g``/``release``) is gone.

Charter §5.3 contract (per Dedo 2026-06-03):
* ``recipient`` is NOT emitted by agents — derived by the orchestrator. Any
  extra field is ignored, not required.
* ``kind=blocked`` carries the blocker in ``question`` (authoritative);
  ``summary`` is human context.
* ``commits`` / ``deliverables`` may be omitted or empty — default to ``[]``.
* ``awaiting`` is one of ``{manazer, none}`` (the operator was renamed
  Director → Manažér in CR-V2-004).

    with bold section headings, numbered/bulleted lists, inline code + code blocks) and THEN the
    ``<<<PIPELINE_STATUS>>>`` status block. :func:`invoke_agent` records only the block's one-line
    ``summary`` as the message ``content`` (the FE ``deriveBrief`` / preview source); the rich report
    body was parsed for the status block and otherwise DISCARDED. This recovers it so the cockpit
    bubble can render the report richly (persisted, additively, as ``payload['report']``).

    Strips BOTH sentinel fences — the ``<<<PIPELINE_STATUS>>>`` status block and, defensively, a
    ``<<<TASK_PLAN_JSON>>>`` fence — wherever they sit, and returns the remaining markdown trimmed.
    Returns ``""`` when the agent emitted nothing but the fence(s). Deterministic; never raises.

    IS the schema (:data:`PIPELINE_STATUS_JSON_SCHEMA` = ``PipelineStatusBlock.model_json_schema()``),
